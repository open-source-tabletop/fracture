# Fracture

When the walls between worlds began to show cracks it presented opportunity, for exploration, expansion, or conquest. But over time these cracks began to expand, the wall fractured and realities began to bleed into one another, bringing war for survival to every corner of reality.

Fracture is a diverse sci-fi tabletop wargame made with the [Cadence Wargame System](https://cadence.games). It offers a wide range of factions, suitable for a large variety of miniatures, and battles at any scale to suit. Fracture: Recon is a small scale skirmish version of Fracture.
