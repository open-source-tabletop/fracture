# Fracture

In the wake of the cataclysmic event known as the Fracture, the boundaries between dimensions have begun to break down, revealing a multiverse teeming with untold potential and peril. In this shifting tapestry of realities, powerful factions are thrown into a battle for survival and supremacy, each harnessing the boundless energy of fractured dimensions to forge their destiny.

Fracture is a sci-fi wargame made with the [Cadence Wargame System](https://cadence.games), set in an open-ended setting, players have the freedom to create their own unique faction from several core types, using any miniatures they want. Customize your forces, adapt your strategy, and tell your own stories.

> Fracture is a great entry point for players coming from other sci-fi games with existing armies but is not designed as a 1:1 proxy for those games.

# Module Rules

Fracture is best played on a battlefield around 3ft by 4ft and is designed for 28mm scale, individually based miniatures. Most games will feature several squads of models and larger games may include vehicles.

A game of Fracture lasts for 4 rounds.

### Morale

As a battle progresses, units in your army will begin to feel the effects of intense battle, their will to fight may break, they may succumb to earlier wounds, be ordered to retreat from a hopeless situation, or any number of unexpected situations - the end result being the same, that the unit is no longer able to fight. To represent these events, armies which have lost at least 50% of their starting units must begin making Morale Tests. Any unit that fails this test is removed from the game as though it had been destroyed.

At the end of any attack in which a unit loses a model, if it is then below half of its original number of modele, it must take a morale test:

- Roll a d6 for the unit and on a roll of 3+ it passes the test.
- If there are any friendly models within 6 inches add 1 to the roll.
- If there are any enemy models within 6 inches subtract 1 from the roll.

### Objectives

Control objectives in Fracture remain secured until an enemy unit attempts to secure it, even if they fail their secure roll.

### Special Rules

| Special Rule | Effect |
| :----------- | :----- |
| Cowardly | This unit automatically fails morale tests. |
| Heroic | This unit may re-roll failed morale tests. |
| Long Shot | This weapon may add 8 inches to it's Range but if it does it reduces it's Attacks to 1. |
| Overcharge | This weapon may add 1 to it's Attacks attribute, if it does so any Attack Roll of 1 counts as hitting the attacking model instead. |
| Unbreakable | This unit automatically passes morale tests. |

# Building an Army

Building your army for Fracture is simple, players agree a maximum number of points then choose their units from a suitable army list, ensuring the total points cost for their models, weapons, and equipment don't exceed that maximum. Each army list is designed to reflect a certain type of faction rather than one single entity, choose the one that best suits your chosen miniatures and play style.

In addition to the maximum points each player can spend there are also 3 categories of unit; Command, Standard, and Specialist. An army must be at least 25% (by points) Standard models, no more than 25% Command models, and no more than 50% Specialist models.

Recommended points for games of Fracture are 500-1000 points for smaller games which can be played on a 3ft by 4ft battlefield and up to 2000 for larger games with a larger battlefield.
