# Fracture

## Playing Fracture

Fracture is best played on a battlefield around 3ft by 4ft and is designed for 28mm scale, individually based miniatures. Most games will feature several squads of models and larger games may include vehicles.

A game of Fracture lasts for 5 rounds.

### Vehicles

Models with the "Vehicle" special rule have the following changes to their rules:

- Vehicles ignore the climbable keyword for terrain, treating them as impassable instead.
- Vehicles count as having the "Non-scoring" special rule.
- Vehicles making an Attack action may use two weapons and target different models with the second weapon, however the second weapon has a -1 modifier to it's Attack Rolls.

### Transports

Transports are vehicles
Non vehicle models
Large counts as 2

### Special Rules

#### Model Special Rules

| Special Rule | Effect |
| :----------- | :----- |
| Rugged | This model ignores the Heavy special rule. |
| Large | This model counts as 2 models for calculating how many models a Transport can carry. |

#### Weapon Special Rules

| Special Rule | Effect |
| :----------- | :----- |
| Long Shot | This weapon may add 8 inches to it's Range but if it does it reduces it's Attacks to 1. |
| Overcharge | This weapon may add 1 or 2 to it's Attacks attribute, if it does so any Attack Roll of 1 counts as hitting the attacking model instead. |
