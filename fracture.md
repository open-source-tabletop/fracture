# Fracture

## Playing Fracture

Fracture is best played on a battlefield around 3ft by 4ft and is designed for 28mm scale, individually based miniatures. Most games will feature several squads of models and larger games may include vehicles.

A game of Fracture lasts for 5 rounds.

### Special Rules

| Special Rule | Effect |
| :----------- | :----- |
| Long Shot | This weapon may add 8 inches to it's Range but if it does it reduces it's Attacks to 1. |
| Overcharge | This weapon may add 1 to it's Attacks attribute, if it does so any Attack Roll of 1 counts as hitting the attacking model instead. |

## Building an Army

Building your army for Fracture is simple, players agree a maximum number of points then choose their units from their army list, ensuring the total points cost for their models, weapons, and equipment don't exceed that maximum. In addition to the maximum points each player can spend there are also 3 categories of unit; Command, Standard, and Specialist. An army must be at least 25% (by points) Standard models, no more than 25% Command models, and no more than 50% Specialist models.

Recommended points for games of Fracture are 500-1000 points for smaller games which can be played on a 3ft by 4ft battlefield and up to 2000 for larger games with a larger battlefield.
