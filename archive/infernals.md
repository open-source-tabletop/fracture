From the depths of a hellish dimension, where chaos and agony become manifest, the Infernals embody pure demonic savagery. Born of darkness and consumed by insatiable bloodlust, these malevolent entities are devoid of mercy or redemption. Their existence is an unending symphony of violence and destruction, as they relish in the art of slaughter.
