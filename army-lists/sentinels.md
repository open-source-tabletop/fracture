## Sentinel Mission

### The Tip of the Spear

Sentinel Forces, with their advanced weapons and armour, are often used as the first strike in an attack. This mission represents the Sentinels attempting to break the battle lines of an enemy army.

The Sentinel player is the attacker in this mission with the other player taking the role as defender.

#### Entry Points and Objectives

After setting up your terrain, the attacker should choose one of the table edges, if the table is rectangular this should be one of the long table edges, and places one Entry Point in the centre of that table edge.

The defender should place 4 Control objectives anywhere on the battlefield, so long as they are at least 9 inches from a table edge or any other objective marker. The Control objectives begin the game secured by the Defender so long as they have 1 model within 3 inches of it.

The Defender treats all 4 objectives as their Entry Points. For this mission, before rolling for initiative the Defender must deploy all their units from reserve. They do not take any actions after being deployed so do not lose any command points.

#### Objectives

This mission does not use Victory Points, instead the attacking player wins the game if they secure at least 3 control objectives at the end of any round, otherwise the defending player wins at the end of round 5.
